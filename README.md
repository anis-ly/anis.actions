# Anis Actions 🚀

A collection of reusable GitHub Actions for .NET projects, designed to streamline CI/CD workflows with TestContainers integration and security scanning.

## Available Actions

### 🔒 Security Check (`security-check`)

A comprehensive action for scanning Docker images for security vulnerabilities using Trivy. Automatically fails workflows on critical/high severity vulnerabilities and creates annotations for warnings.

#### Features

- 🔍 **Vulnerability Scanning** - Deep security analysis using Aqua Security's Trivy
- 🎯 **Configurable Severity** - Set custom thresholds for failing builds
- 📊 **Detailed Reporting** - Comprehensive vulnerability summaries with severity breakdowns
- 🚨 **GitHub Annotations** - Automatic annotations for all detected vulnerabilities
- 📦 **Artifact Upload** - Scan results saved as artifacts for detailed analysis
- ⚙️ **Flexible Configuration** - Ignore unfixed vulnerabilities, set timeouts, and more

#### Usage

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  security-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Security scan
      uses: your-username/anis.actions/security-check@v1
      with:
        image: 'myorg/myapp:latest'
        severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
```

#### Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `image` | Docker image to scan (e.g., nginx:latest) | ✅ Yes | - |
| `severity` | Comma-separated severities to fail on | ❌ No | `CRITICAL,HIGH` |
| `format` | Output format (table, json, sarif) | ❌ No | `table` |
| `trivy-version` | Version of Trivy to use | ❌ No | `latest` |
| `ignore-unfixed` | Ignore vulnerabilities without fixes | ❌ No | `false` |
| `timeout` | Timeout for scan (e.g., 5m, 10m) | ❌ No | `5m` |

#### Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `scan-result` | Result of the security scan (passed/failed) |
| `vulnerabilities-found` | Number of vulnerabilities found |

#### Behavior

- **Workflow Failure**: The action will **fail the workflow** when vulnerabilities matching the configured severity levels are found
  - Default severities: `CRITICAL,HIGH` (configurable via `severity` input)
  - Uses Trivy's `--exit-code 1` flag to detect vulnerabilities
  - The workflow will stop and prevent deployment if vulnerabilities are detected
- **GitHub Annotations**:
  - **CRITICAL/HIGH**: Error annotations (red) 
  - **MEDIUM**: Warning annotations (yellow)
  - **LOW/UNKNOWN**: Notice annotations (blue)
- **Job Summary**: Detailed vulnerability breakdown with severity counts and full scan results
- **Artifacts**: JSON and text reports uploaded for detailed offline analysis (retained for 30 days)

#### Important Notes

⚠️ **The workflow WILL fail** if vulnerabilities matching your severity threshold are found. This is by design to prevent insecure deployments.

If you need to:
- **Ignore unfixed vulnerabilities**: Set `ignore-unfixed: 'true'`
- **Allow specific severities**: Adjust the `severity` input (e.g., `CRITICAL` only)
- **Review before fixing**: Check the job summary and artifacts for detailed vulnerability information

#### Example with Multiple Images

```yaml
jobs:
  security-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        image: 
          - 'nginx:latest'
          - 'alpine:latest'
          - 'postgres:15'
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Scan ${{ matrix.image }}
      uses: your-username/anis.actions/security-check@v1
      with:
        image: ${{ matrix.image }}
        severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
        ignore-unfixed: 'true'
```

### 🧪 Run Tests (`run-tests`)

A comprehensive action for running .NET integration tests with TestContainers support, code coverage collection, and detailed reporting.

#### Features

- ✅ **Multi-version .NET support** - Configurable .NET SDK versions
- 🐳 **TestContainers ready** - Automatic Docker setup and validation  
- 📊 **Code coverage** - Optional XPlat code coverage collection
- 📝 **Detailed logging** - Comprehensive test output and reporting
- 📦 **Artifact upload** - Automatic test results and coverage uploads
- 🔄 **Codecov integration** - Optional coverage reporting to Codecov

#### Usage

```yaml
name: Integration Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Run integration tests
      uses: your-username/anis.actions/run-tests@v1
      with:
        dotnet-version: '9.0.x'
        test-project-path: './tests/MyProject.IntegrationTests'
        configuration: 'Release'
        collect-coverage: 'true'
```
